Hi there,

Welcome to my diabetes prediction reserach project Github repository.

As a high school student I always had a passion and desire to develop an research project involving AI and ML. During my brainstorming sessions for project ideas, I was suddenly intriguiged by the global diabetes prevalence. That's when I decided to develop an Diabetes prediction research project exploring different ML models to predict diabetes type 2. To fully understand my project, please look through the uploaded documnets and consider reading the reserach paper to understand my findings.

Thank you so much for visiting my GitHub repository.

Best Regards,

Shripad Mangavalli
