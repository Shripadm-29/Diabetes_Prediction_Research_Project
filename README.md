Hi there,

Welcome to my diabetes prediction research project GitHub repository.

As a high school student, I always had a passion and desire to develop a research project involving AI and ML. During my brainstorming sessions for project ideas, I was suddenly intrigued by the global diabetes prevalence. That's when I decided to develop a diabetes prediction research project exploring different ML models to predict diabetes type 2. To fully understand my project, please look through the uploaded documents and consider reading the research paper to understand my findings.

Thank you so much for visiting my GitHub repository.

Best Regards,

Shripad Mangavalli
